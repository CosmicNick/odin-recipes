# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project!
This will be my first project that I am working on through Odin. 
The task is to create an html site for recipes. Who doesn't like food?
I will use my current beginning html skills to complete this project. 
While I am a relatively a fast learner there is no doubt I may have to look back
for some help. I will be creating files, linking images to pages, creating folders and using the other basic html commands to help me complete this project. I look forward to building this!
